// npm install global binaries on Unix with symlinks. But on Windows, it creates
// a small `*.cmd` file (https://github.com/npm/cmd-shim) that just forwards to
// `{executable} ...` where executable is guessed from the shabang (if any).
// This is because Windows cannot execute shabang files otherwise.
// It also does it with a Bash file and a `*.ps1` file (Powershell).
// However the shim files prioritize the global binaries directory over the
// `PATH` environment variable by looking for a sibling `node.exe`. But `nve`
// needs to use the `PATH` environment variable.
// We fix this by copying the shim file to a directory that we push in front of
// the `PATH`. This removes that prioritization since there are no more
// `node.exe`.
// The fix is npm-specific. Yarn does not have that issue. Although it also
// checks for a sibling `node.exe`, there is never such a file in practice.
